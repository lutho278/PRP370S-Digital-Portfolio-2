###   Evidence
### Reflection: Interview Skills (STAR Method)

**S – Situation**  
During the PRP370S Work Readiness Training, I completed the Interview Skills module, which focused on preparing for real-world job interviews by understanding interview types, common questions, and answering techniques.

**T – Task**  
My objective was to develop professional interview competence by learning how to respond effectively to behavioral and situational questions using structured frameworks such as STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

**A – Action**  
I practiced identifying the intention behind interview questions and learned to answer them using the STAR method. For example, I learned to describe the **Situation**, explain my **Task**, detail my **Actions**, and conclude with the **Result** and lessons learned. I also improved my awareness of the importance of preparation, company research, clear communication, and confident body language.

**R – Result**  
As a result, I am now able to present my experiences in a structured and professional manner during interviews. I feel more confident handling difficult or unexpected questions and can make a strong and positive impression on potential employers. This skill is valuable for my future career in the ICT and multimedia industry.
