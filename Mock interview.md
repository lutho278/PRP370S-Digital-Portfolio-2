### Reflection: Mock Interview Video

**S – Situation**  
As part of my PRP370S Work Readiness Training, I recorded an interview video where I introduced myself, discussed my qualifications, technical skills, and personal interests. The purpose was to simulate a professional interview and demonstrate my communication skills and confidence to potential recruiters.

**T – Task**  
The main goal was to present myself effectively as a candidate ready for the workplace. I needed to express my abilities clearly, highlight my strengths as a multimedia and ICT student, and explain how I handle challenging situations in a professional manner.

**A – Action**  
I prepared by reviewing my CV and identifying key points to discuss, such as my studies in Information and Communication Technology, my design and technical skills, and my hobbies that support creativity and balance. During the video, I maintained confident body language, clear speech, and thoughtful responses when explaining how I approach difficult tasks — emphasizing problem-solving, persistence, and teamwork. I also practiced my delivery to ensure I came across as authentic and well-prepared.

**R – Result**  
The interview video effectively showcased my professionalism, confidence, and communication abilities. I received positive feedback for my presentation skills and clarity of thought. This experience helped me build confidence for real-world interviews and improved my ability to articulate my strengths and goals to future employers.
